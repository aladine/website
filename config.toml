Apart from building the software for the clients, one major issue I had to repeatedly deal with was the way Python was designed and how I had to fight against it to achieve the desired functionality. This led me to read and understand how Python internals work; which in turn only made me feel the need for a more elegantly designed runtime.  Initially I did not appreciate Go but the more I read about its design, the more it felt like a properly done language/runtime. After using it for a few small projects, it was easier to appreciate it and propose using it at work. I have learned a decent bit and continue to learn the interesting parts of Go but perhaps the path could have been easier if certain topics were more accessible.  Purpose of my Talk My proposed talk is about topics which I feel if I had a consolidated article/talk on, it would have been easier for me to learn faster while making fewer mistakes along the way. I believe that I might not be the only one who would benefit from these topics and I would like to present them to Go community if possible."
